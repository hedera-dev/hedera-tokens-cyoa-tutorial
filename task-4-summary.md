### Task (4) - Summary and Tear Down

In this task, you will round out the tasks for this tutorial by taking a look at the metrics, and shutting down the project cleanly.

```
🔢 Summary metrics  …
```

👀 We have noticed that each time we have run a script, that there is a “**Summary Metrics**” section printed at the end.
This helps us to understand how quickly we have managed to set up and complete each of the tasks, and how long we have taken to complete all of the tasks thus far.
It even shows us how many errors we made along the way.

Let’s take a look at it.

👀 The “**time to first task completion**” is the time taken to complete the set up script plus complete the very first task. This is sometimes also known as “time to hello world”. The “**time to all tasks completion**” is the total duration taken to complete the set up script plus complete all of the tasks. This gives us an idea of how complex the tutorial is.

The rest of the output gives us more granular information about the individual tasks.

Before we wrap up, there’s one more thing.
We’re running Gitpod, which is a cloud development environment, and this is billed per unit time of usage.
If we’re on the free plan, we’re using up the limited number of free hours, and if we’re on the paid plan, we might be incurring some payment.
Therefore, it is always a good idea to remember to terminate the Gitpod workspace as soon as we’re done.

👉 To do so, let’s click on the triple line icons in the top right corner.
👉 In the menu, select “Gitpod: Stop Workspace”.
👀 We’ll see a spinner - **a bouncing logo** - while Gitpod shuts down this instance.
Click on the “Go to Dashboard” button.
This takes us to a list of workspaces.
Identify the one that we’ve been using.
👉 Click on the vertical ellipses (three dots).
👀 Here, we could select “**Open**” to restart the Gitpod workspace, where we left off, if this is what we’d like to do.
👉For now, since we do not intend to do that, select “**Delete**” to delete this instance.

We have completed this tutorial!
Let’s do a quick recap

You’ve learnt how to:
- Create a fungible token using the Hedera SDK on Hedera Token Service (HTS)
- Create an ERC20 token using Solidity and viem on Hedera Smart Contract Service (HSCS)
- Discovered how HTS and HSCS are interoperable via Hedera System Contracts

Congratulations on completing the Choose-your-own-Adventure tutorial for minting and transferring tokens on Hedera\!
